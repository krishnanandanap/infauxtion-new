# INFAUXTION


## "Want to ruin your health in record time? We‚Äôll show you how ‚Äî one terrible decision at a time."**

### Infauxtion is a comedy-driven health quiz that tempts you into terrible choices, shows you the hilarious consequences, then gives you the real science to do it right.


### The ‚Äúuseless‚Äù problem Infauxtion solves is that most health education is boring, forgettable, and easy to ignore.By mixing absurd humor with real science, it grabs attention, makes people actually want to engage, and helps the lessons stick ‚Äî even if they came for the laughs first.



### We fight boring health advice with chaos, comedy, and catastrophically bad role-modeling.You pick the worst option, we pile on ridiculous consequences, then‚Äîsurprise!‚Äîwe sneak in the real, useful science before you completely destroy yourself.
